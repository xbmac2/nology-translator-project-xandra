## Morse Code Translator

This project is a Morse code translator that handles translation from English to Morse code, and vice versa.

Select the input language from the buttons above the input field.

Input is dynamically translated as the user types, and error messages appear on the page when the input is invalid.

### Potential Future Features
- Clicking a button displays a table showing the English to Morse cypher
- Show more specific error when user inputs incorrect Morse (the input is dots and dashes, but is not an actual Morse sequence)
